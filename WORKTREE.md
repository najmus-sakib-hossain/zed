So, as these types of coding agent tools like Codex, Cloud CLI, Google Anti-Gravity Code Editor, Cursor Code Editor, VS Code Code Editor have come but they all have one thing in common: if multiple agents work on the same GitHub repo, it messes things up very quickly. The famous YouTuber Theo GG mentioned this problem in both X Platform and YouTube video that what tree currently no one does right. I am creating my own DX code editor by forking Jit Code Editor. Now, all of the above current production-level AI coding agent tools are mostly on Node.js ecosystem, so they are very slow and performance-less. But as I am creating DX code editor by forking zed Code Editor, which is the fastest rust Code Editor, we can fix this problem correctly. Please give me a only Rust way that we can solve about this problem where multiple AI agents can work on the same GitHub or Git codebase see endlessly without missing things up and give me game-changing out-of-the-box suggestions to fix this work tree problem!!!
