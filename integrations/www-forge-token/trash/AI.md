This is the current status of our code editor chatbot. Now we have to work on it to change some stuff. From the chatbot now for starters, please explain what you can see so that we can do next steps.
You are mostly correctly but wrong about many thing - now try to understand what I am about to say and if don't understand than instead of doing any stupid stuffs:

# ChatInput
```markdown
1. So, current the placeholder text is in the top of the chat input please make it one line bottom and ther in the left please use our icon library lucide packs attact icon and download if not already present in aseets folder and then please put that icon in the top left of the chat input

2. And in the bottom there before "Ai profiles selector like Ask, Write and Minimal" if one chat session we are showing a context pie chart like circle please move that from there and put in the chat input top rigth zoom icon and make sure to put in the top rigth of chat input and it should show everything time not only in chat sessions

3. Now, in the chat input bottom there is Ai profile, Ai model selector please more those to the chat input bottom left and in there please also add a new selector called "Target selector" in there please list these:
1. Local
2. Background
3. Cloud
And pleas use selector icon and also please use suitable icons from lucide-pack using our icon commamnd

4. In the top right of the chat input please put another icon called "Enhance" and it will enhance the prompt so in the top right of the chat input there will be three items - zoom icon, enhance icon and context pie chart icon. Please make sure to put them in the right order and also make sure to use suitable icons from lucide-pack using our icon command

5. Now as we moved the context pie chart to the top right of the chat input and also added enhance icon there, And also moved the add in the top left of the chat input so there is - Follow Zed agent button, Agent Profile selector, Ai model selector, And submit/stop button

```

# Chat Input Top
```markdown
In our chat session at the bottom right now, we are showing 5 icons instead of showing them in the bottom right. Please show them in the bottom center. And for now on, please hide the like and dislike icon from there. 
```

# File Explorer Sidebar
```markdown
Currently in the world File Explorer sidebar at our code editor there is horizontal scroll, but horizontal scroll on File Explorer looks very bad. So please make sure to truncate the files and folder names instead of giving horizontal scroll, and there shouldn't be any horizontal scroll in our File Explorer sidebar. 
```
