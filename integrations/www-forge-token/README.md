Good, now please learn from this and create all the crates in our crates folder to save tokens listed in this token.md file. In the DX crates you don't have to create the serializer or rlm crate as I already created it somewhere else. Users create all other things.

So what is DX? DX is a software to enhance development experience on 24 February 2026. Normal division of category doesn't apply to dx, which means that dx is not only an AI automation or AI chatbot. It's a mixture of many things but all things are not different from each other. They are connected with the same purpose of being a tool to enhance development experience.

A tool that uses Rust programming language, not NodeJs useless trash to save tokens. Be fast and even run on any low-end device and also use the power of a higher device to give more features, speed, and powers on a higher device. Basically dx will gain speed if you have a good operating system but also can run smoothly on a lower device. DX gives free access to AI. It has support for literally any providers but not only that, DX by default can run even offline unlimited and we will only use tokens and So dx will have an application for literally all of the operating systems, for macOS, Linux, and Windows desktop apps. It will use Rust, Z teams GPUI to make the fastest AI agent desktop app in the world because all of the current AI applications, like Cloud, Codex, and all others, use Node.js, which is highly inefficient and bad. Not only that, DX can also generate literally anything you name. It can do coding, can do charts, can do deep things, can do any kind of tool calling MCP, ACP, a2a. Not only that, it can also generate literally any media, like a video, 3D audio, music, and talk to you and everything else. Not only that, the biggest feature of DX by Vercel's competitors is its token-saving techniques. In 2023, MIT researchers already proved that using the RLM method saves 80-90% of tokens on bigger files. For some reason, competitors didn't apply this globally or at a more production level because they use Node.js, which is just slower. Maybe using RLM is just not that of a good deal as RLM is really a time-consuming technique. DX is built using Rust so it solves the very problem that makes RLM a second thought for any other competitor. Rust has more speed than Node.js so that's why DX can utilize its Rust-based system to even make the RLM useful, hence saving tokens.

Not only that, DX saves tokens on every tool calling as it uses the DX serializer, which saves 70-90% of tokens rather than the bloated JSON. Also DX literally uses all of the techniques to save tokens here and there. And not only that, DX has extensions for literally every production-level software:
1. It has a browser extension.
2. It has an editor and ide extension.
3. It has video editor extensions like premierpro, capcut, davinci resolve, and filmicpro.
4. It has plugins for any image software like Photoshop, Adobe, and Affinity, and literally any other professional-grade apps have the support extensions for DX so that they can have the powers of DX everywhere.
We also have apps for Android, iOS, Mac, Linux, and Windows apps operating system.
