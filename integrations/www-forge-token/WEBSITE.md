As you can see from the screenshot, in our Download Apps Icon Cards, the MacOS and iOS icons are the same. Please use different icons there. Those two operating systems are lowercase, so please make them camel case like other operating systems.
Also, next to VPS, please add another icon card with more icons that represent that we support more operating systems. For Mac OS, Linux, and Windows, these three operating systems have cull command. Others don't have any cull command.
Please also put the details that cull command automatically downloads all DX extensions by reading your operating system correctly. 

Good, please update some information about our website and the software from our website correctly:
1. We will launch on 3rd March 2026; 
2. please remove the LinkedIn from our company and other places and put Discord there.
3. And in our landing page header download operating system icon cards:
- Please add VPS icon and also more icon.
- When the download card is hovered please show a shadcn-UI hovered card.
- In the hovered card please show details about the download process of each operating system.
- If you have any stuff present in the UI, like if it's macOS, Windows, and Linux desktop apps, then in the hovered card also put a would copy UI where you put the curl command to download the dx binary.
- For other operating systems please put other details of the download process like for our browser we only support the browser extension that requires it to be downloaded as an extension file and manually uploading it in the browser, things like that.
- Please show all the details there correctly.

Awesome now please do these:
1. there is transparent popovers and selection in the header so please use our design system background colors correctly
2. We are dx - just "dx" not dxlabs or other so please rename every typos from our website
3. in the landing page there is still pricing sections so please make it "free foreever"
4. At here please at the hero donwload os apps please use put a current command to downlaod dx

For platforms icons please use solar icon pack!!! and do these:
1. Please show all the images in our website with more contrast, brightness, and sharpness
2. Update the pricing to be free forever!!!
3. In the footer currently only dx but please in big text size please put:
- Enhanced
- Development 
- Experience 
in a loop one by one text!!!

All the image in this website Cis in lowers quility so please make a web search about how to show images in nextjs in higher quility and do that for all images in this website and make things like the hero descriptions is not in the center so please put them in the center correctly!!! and on the hero top under the description please show all os icons like macos, linux, windows, android, ios, tv, watch, tablet, chrome-os, browser-extension, ide-extension and all os  in a box with maintaining midday design system - later we will implement click to download app but for now just show them

Please create a plan to update the midday/apps/website to our dx website and create a plan to show all these details to hype users but please make sure to use midday design system - the reason we are using midday fork is for their design system so please use their design system correclty just put our contents!!!

So DX is not only one software. Its goal is to enhance the development experience of any user, so it technically is made to serve everyone, literally everyone. How DX works? DX has native apps for literally all operating systems you name it:
- Mac OS
- Windows
- Linux
- Android
- iOS
- Chrome OS
- tablet
- watch OS
- TV OS
And everything you can possibly think ofAnd also, DX has a remote website right here from where you can manage all of those operating systems from the browser. It literally supports all of the AI LLM providers, even more than what opencode supports. It supports more than 100 LLM providers. And also, by default, DX can also run offline. It uses RLM, DX serializer, image tokenizer, and all kinds of techniques to save tokens 30 to 90%. And it is built using Rust can save up to 70% of your RAM while doing the same thing that others do and more. It has support over 400 connects. You can link any skill from cloud cli or any plugin from cloud cli. You can also link any social media or communication apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and things like that. And also DX has:
1. text generation
2. image generation
3. video generation
4. 3D AR VR generation
5. Others: document designation, like PDF docs and things like that
It has a mode for:
1. Ask
2. Agent
3. Plan
4. Search
5. Study
6. Research
It also has extensions for all production-level software:
1. Browsers - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and all the popular ones
2. IDE - Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and all the popular ones
3. Photoshop
4. Figma
5. Davinci Resolve
And all the popular ones you can think of!!!
Also dx has some built-in tools like:
1. forge - for VCS for not only code but all types of media that will go viral amoun all common users as its gives version control on their big media video with unlimited youtube, soundcloud, and all the popular media platforms support. 
Now, I got the single most brillient idea that you have heard in this year 2026 - Vibe coders and these new half baked tech reviewers don't care about how it works but they only care what it does so for our forge - we need some sort of unlimited storage as if pull of VCS with a never make headaqe again solution then we will go viral in dx in seconds so in forge:
1. video will be stored to user's youtube channel as unlisted draft video - means unlimited storage with no worry
2. image - will be stored on users pinterest acccount
3. audio - anything that works like spotify or think like that
4. 3d/ar/vr - any 3d related big platform
5. code and other docs - users github/gitlab/bitbuck or all at once
So, thats means they not only get VCS for any media but also have a safe backup for any of their media and its in way that its uses all powers of the fact that its written in rust and dx is the one who introduced this so we will go viral in hours!!!
Good, now yeah for pro users we can do r2 bucket storage like you have suggested (Pro Fallback (recommended for studios)) - Yeah, and we will also support all cloud storage like google drive, dropbox, mega and everything - but guess what we will support them but youtube, soundcloud, pinterest, Sketchfab and github will never go out of storage or user buget as those are free unlimited and we will go viral only if everything without even spedning any money can do this as I already told those half baked tech reviewers don't care how its done but is it done and whats done!!! And we will go viral with our dx!!!

2. traffic security: it is way dx agent does everything automatically but stil maintain securiy of the users data. There is red, yellow and green - when dx ai agent spot that its is harmless job then it automatically does it and | And if its a little sensitive but not that much then its may do its but will give warming to user or notify the user silently and | And if its a sensitive task then its more warns the user more notiblity and puts its in red list but still does the job like - if its a delete operation then it auto does it but makes a small backup of that file or folder so that the user has a backup so that way dx agent will do everything automatically but still maintaining user security!!! It auto hashes all passwords and sensitive data before sending it to any third-party services. It also has a built-in firewall that can block any malicious traffic and protect the user's data from being compromised. It also has a built-in VPN that can encrypt all traffic and protect the user's data from being intercepted by hackers.

3. check: its check security and gives 500 score anime fantasy style rank system based on folder and files naming, errors and overral structure!!! It has f, e, d, c, b, a, s, ss, sss, ssss, sssss ranks and also gives suggestions to improve the score and make it more secure. It also has a built-in vulnerability scanner that can scan for common vulnerabilities in code and media assets and give suggestions to fix them. It also has a built-in code linter that can check for code quality issues and give suggestions to improve the code. It also has a built-in media linter that can check for media quality issues and give suggestions to improve the media assets.
