Good, now please rebranding everything to be dx instead of zeroclaw!!!

So DX is not only one software. Its goal is to enhance the development experience of any user, so it technically is made to serve everyone, literally everyone. How DX works? DX has native apps for literally all operating systems you name it:
- Mac OS
- Windows
- Linux
- Android
- iOS
- Chrome OS
- tablet
- watch OS
- TV OS
And everything you can possibly think ofAnd also, DX has a remote website right here from where you can manage all of those operating systems from the browser. It literally supports all of the AI LLM providers, even more than what opencode supports. It supports more than 100 LLM providers. And also, by default, DX can also run offline. It uses RLM, DX serializer, image tokenizer, and all kinds of techniques to save tokens 30 to 90%. And it is built using Rust can save up to 70% of your RAM while doing the same thing that others do and more. It has support over 400 connects. You can link any skill from cloud cli or any plugin from cloud cli. You can also link any social media or communication apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and things like that. And also DX has:
1. text generation
2. image generation
3. video generation
4. 3D AR VR generation
5. Others: document designation, like PDF docs and things like that
It has a mode for:
1. Ask
2. Agent
3. Plan
4. Search
5. Study
6. Research
It also has extensions for all production-level software:
1. Browsers - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and all the popular ones
2. IDE - Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and all the popular ones
3. Photoshop
4. Figma
5. Davinci Resolve
And all the popular ones you can think of!!!
Also dx has some built-in tools like:
1. forge - for VCS for not only code but all types of media that will go viral amoun all common users as its gives version control on their big media video with unlimited youtube, soundcloud, and all the popular media platforms support. 
Now, I got the single most brillient idea that you have heard in this year 2026 - Vibe coders and these new half baked tech reviewers don't care about how it works but they only care what it does so for our forge - we need some sort of unlimited storage as if pull of VCS with a never make headaqe again solution then we will go viral in dx in seconds so in forge:
1. video will be stored to user's youtube channel as unlisted draft video - means unlimited storage with no worry
2. image - will be stored on users pinterest acccount
3. audio - anything that works like spotify or think like that
4. 3d/ar/vr - any 3d related big platform
5. code and other docs - users github/gitlab/bitbuck or all at once
So, thats means they not only get VCS for any media but also have a safe backup for any of their media and its in way that its uses all powers of the fact that its written in rust and dx is the one who introduced this so we will go viral in hours!!!
Good, now yeah for pro users we can do r2 bucket storage like you have suggested (Pro Fallback (recommended for studios)) - Yeah, and we will also support all cloud storage like google drive, dropbox, mega and everything - but guess what we will support them but youtube, soundcloud, pinterest, Sketchfab and github will never go out of storage or user buget as those are free unlimited and we will go viral only if everything without even spedning any money can do this as I already told those half baked tech reviewers don't care how its done but is it done and whats done!!! And we will go viral with our dx!!!

2. traffic security: it is way dx agent does everything automatically but stil maintain securiy of the users data. There is red, yellow and green - when dx ai agent spot that its is harmless job then it automatically does it and | And if its a little sensitive but not that much then its may do its but will give warming to user or notify the user silently and | And if its a sensitive task then its more warns the user more notiblity and puts its in red list but still does the job like - if its a delete operation then it auto does it but makes a small backup of that file or folder so that the user has a backup so that way dx agent will do everything automatically but still maintaining user security!!! It auto hashes all passwords and sensitive data before sending it to any third-party services. It also has a built-in firewall that can block any malicious traffic and protect the user's data from being compromised. It also has a built-in VPN that can encrypt all traffic and protect the user's data from being intercepted by hackers. It also has a built-in intrusion detection system that can detect any suspicious activity and alert the user immediately. It also has a built-in DDoS protection system that can protect the user's data from being overwhelmed by a DDoS attack. It also has a built-in security monitoring system that can monitor all traffic and alert the user of any potential security threats.

3. check: its check security and gives 500 score anime fantasy style rank system based on folder and files naming, errors and overral structure!!! It has f, e, d, c, b, a, s, ss, sss, ssss, sssss ranks and also gives suggestions to improve the score and make it more secure. It also has a built-in vulnerability scanner that can scan for common vulnerabilities in code and media assets and give suggestions to fix them. It also has a built-in code linter that can check for code quality issues and give suggestions to improve the code. It also has a built-in media linter that can check for media quality issues and give suggestions to improve the media assets. It also has a built-in security audit feature where users can run a security audit on their projects and get a detailed report of any security issues found and how to fix them.

4. media: has support from all audio, video, image, 3D/AR/VR platforms. It can fetch from any providers like unsplash, pexels, pixabay for images, youtube, vimeo for videos, spotify, soundcloud for audio and sketchfab and thingiverse for 3D models. It can also fetch from any custom media providers that users can link to their dx account. It also has a built-in media editor that can do basic editing like cropping, resizing, trimming, and more advanced editing like color correction, audio mixing, and 3D model manipulation. It also has a media library where users can organize their media assets and easily access them from any of their projects. It has more than 5000+ fonts and 219+ icon-sets with more than 1 million icons. It also has a built-in font and icon manager where users can easily search, preview, and manage their fonts and icons. It also has support for custom fonts and icons that users can upload to their dx account and use in their projects. It also has a media version control system where users can track changes to their media assets and revert to previous versions if needed. It also has a media collaboration feature where users can share their media assets with their team members and collaborate on them in real-time.

5. workspace(maintain a clean and organized workspace across any ide or place), serializer(most human readable, most token efficient, and fastest serializer in the world), i18n(convert any text to any language and sts, tts free unlimited), driven(maintain spec-driven ai workflow instead of vibe-coding ai slop), dcp(MCP, A2A, ACP but more token efficient, faster and better)
