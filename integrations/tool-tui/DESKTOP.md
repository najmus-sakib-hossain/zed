We can use zed ai realted crates but just not the workspace, editor and project related code so we have to update those files to comment our those related and edit so that they can work without the workspace, editor and project

No, there gotta be someway study the actual integrations/zed and learn that do they internally use the workspace, editor and project heavy package to all ai related crates or not - as if not then we can use them as standone with just a little tweack to comment out the have deps
