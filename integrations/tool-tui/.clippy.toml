# Clippy Configuration for dx-www-runtime
# Note: Clippy doesn't support per-lint configuration in clippy.toml
# Use #[allow(clippy::lint_name)] attributes or Cargo.toml for lint configuration
# This file is for clippy-specific settings only

# Cognitive complexity threshold
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30

# Documentation note:
# To configure lint levels, add to Cargo.toml:
# [lints.clippy]
# perf = "deny"
# correctness = "deny"
# style = "warn"
# Or use #![warn(clippy::perf)] in lib.rs/main.rs

# Safety-related lint configuration notes:
# The following lints should be enabled in production crates via Cargo.toml or lib.rs:
#
# [lints.clippy]
# undocumented_unsafe_blocks = "warn"  # Require SAFETY comments on unsafe blocks
# unwrap_used = "warn"                  # Discourage .unwrap() in production code
# expect_used = "warn"                  # Discourage .expect() in production code (use proper error handling)
# panic = "warn"                        # Discourage panic!() in production code
#
# Or in lib.rs/main.rs:
# #![warn(clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks)]
# #![warn(clippy::unwrap_used)]
#
# Test modules should use #[cfg_attr(test, allow(clippy::unwrap_used))] to allow unwrap in tests
