# Dx Product Overview

Dx is a binary-first full-stack development platform built entirely in Rust, designed to replace the JavaScript ecosystem with unprecedented performance through WebAssembly, binary protocols, and compile-time optimization.

## Core Philosophy

- Binary Everywhere: Zero parse, zero GC, zero hydration
- Zero-Cost Abstractions: Stack-only allocation, direct DOM manipulation
- LLM-Optimized: Token-efficient serialization formats (52-73% savings vs JSON)
