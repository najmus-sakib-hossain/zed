# Now, here is the biggest task - you have to create it production ready and following all pro standards -

So, as you know forge is just not VCS - it also controls the dx-tools version alonside decides what tools to runs in what order of dx-tools - So, you have to make this forge put a forge rust crate that I will publish on crates and will later use it in other dx-tools - dx has so many tools - some of the closes upcoming packages are: -style - css generator from classnames but 100 times faster than tailwindcss that is build using oxide and rust -internationalization - can generate locales for 256 languages for free unlimited and also can generate tts for 256 languages free and unlimited - just editing the main locales/en.json file -ui - can add any components from dx-r2 storage - thing like them as shadcn component but more professional component + more better design and more components!!! so in any js, jsx, ts, tsx file when you write "dx followed by a component name from dx-ui it dx will remove that text and put a import line at the top of the time and then adds the components in the right path - plus you get intellicense in code editors or just go the website and copy that less than one line code if you want or just from the website there's a feature called cart where you select more component in just one copy - this is where our branching h truly shine with green, red, yellow brancing!!! But they should added for all tools -icons - like dx-ui, you just have to write dxi and a code editor interllicence will pop up and will choose right icon for you job from more than 150 sets of icon pack and more than 1m+ icons -fonts - like ui and icons it will be similar with giving you 1000+ fonts -check - it will format and lint files on save or changes -auth - like the ui, icon and fonts it will add or remove files related to auth as you write code - like if you write something that needs google social media then ti will pop inside right folder so you only get what files you need So, as you can by doing so you will only get what you need - it will beat nodejs, npm, bun, yarn, pnpm as using those you also download so much package that may need but in many cases you just need a arguably small logic from that huge node_modules folder and other files can have some files that has low security and if they do have low security then you have no way as node_modules folde ris huge enough to not be verified and you have the mentality that you install a package and it solves everything but most of the time the thing you need is probly more easier to even bother installing it inside node_modules and when you are deploying it to the cloud even the node_modules folder counts - so dx will beat them as you will get the code inside the files and folder that you see so they will be transparent and h be smaller by even point from the developer writing those package in dx - so this way dx will beat everyone!!! I am really liking what have you done - now just to be clear: So, forge is the main orchestrator in dx and what is dx - in future it will be a code editor too and for now I will release a binary of dx which will have all these dx tools like dx-style, dx-auth, dx-font, dx-icons, dx-ui etc integrated into it and forge will also tool of dx that will be a better VCS than git but not only that it will also orchesstrate all the dx tools and make them work together seamlessly. So users will download dx binary and when they will write dx on their terminal then it will open a open line by default just running dx will open a openai-codex or gemini-cli like ai interface in the bottom and showing some most popular dx command details - Then dx will be like ohhmyzsh type of experience where users can customize their os and then dx will provide some popular shell package built-into it like fuzzy finder, autocomplete, shell memory and much more. Now I will simontaniously also create a dx LSP and code editor extensions for all code editors and if the dx extension or LSP is present then that extension will have a connection like vscode and git has between whenever a file is changed it will cache and will be watched by dx-forge and dx-forge will then run the relevant dx-tools on that file and will provide a better developer experience. As dx will not just only be doning VSC stuffs but also manage package like package managers like npm, bun, pip or cargo that's why every pacakge installed by dx will more secure than those package managers and then fact that dx will put those files mostly in code and then manage its versioning using forge will not only make them transparent but also more maintainable than other package managers and developers can will have proper package controls about dx will put their packages and how they will managed and updated. So dx will be a complete developer experience toolchain that will provide everything a developer needs to write code and manage their projects efficiently. That's why even your are using other people's code it will be infact your own code as you can put your own varients of that package and manage them and in dx website alongside packages there will also be varients of those packages made by other developers so you can choose which varient you want to use and also you can contribute to those varients too this can be handy in many times and then overall contributing cycle will be much more easier, faster and secure as when you update a package using dx-forge it will most of the time just update some small amount of files in your code so most likely you can just review those changes and accept what you want rather than updating the whole package and then breaking your code this way dx-forge will also provide a better package management experience too. As dx will treat it own generated code like code generated by dx-style, dx-ui, dx-auth, dx-icons, dx-fonts specially so new developers can blen into dx ecosystem easily and be more be transparent and write code that is needed rather than writing boilerplate code and then managing them manually. Ohh and and other thing to make dx truly a magical experience - You only need only one dx.json/dx.toml/dx.toon/dx.yaml/dx.ts/dx.js/.dx file in your root project - even through dx can run on zero config but if you want to configure something then you will only need one file where's before you needed multiple config files - one for formatter - one for linter - one for orm - one for ui but with dx only need only one file for dx-style, dx-ui, dx-auth, dx-icons, dx-fonts, dx-media, dx-forge and many more dx-tools in future and not only that when you will be updating dx config file if dx daemon is running then it will update the whole file content based on your changes - like if you are configuring dx-style then it will put all dx-style related configs with its default where you cursor is so it will make magical experience!!! And then in config file there will be some additional features like ci/cd + workspace management which will make your codebase compatable with any code editors, IDEs, Ai agents or manage your monorep codebase effeciently. And in.dx folder there will be some files like.dx/forge much like.git folder,.dx/style there will be binary style.bin for offline dx-style support and can be used for version control too as base code, dx-ui like dx-style will also have its own binary file for offline support and version control too. So, all things done by dx will transparent and be provide a magical developer experience. So, after explaining all these please make more dx-forge logic names so that I can implement them and make forge more better and professional. Now, make sure to make this forge to provide files changes trigger by LSP or file save via Dual-Watcher Architecture - then provide separate versioning for dx-tools and ability to orcastrate tools stating and ending point so that other dx tool can obey it correctly!!!
