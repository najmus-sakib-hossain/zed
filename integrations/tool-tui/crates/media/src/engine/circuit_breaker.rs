//! Circuit breaker implementation for provider resilience.
//!
//! Implements the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
//! when providers become unavailable or start failing.
//!
//! # Lock Poisoning Recovery
//!
//! All methods that access the internal `RwLock` handle poisoned locks gracefully.
//! If a thread panics while holding the lock, subsequent operations will recover
//! by extracting the inner value and logging a warning. This ensures the circuit
//! breaker remains functional even after thread panics.
