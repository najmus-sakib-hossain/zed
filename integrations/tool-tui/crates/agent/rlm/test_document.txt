- LRU eviction policy
- 85% cache hit ratio
- Reduces database load by 80%

Database Optimization:
- Connection pooling (20-100 connections)
- Query optimization with proper indexes
- Batch inserts for bulk operations
- Read replicas for scaling

Async Processing:
- Background job processing with Celery
- Message queue for decoupling services
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue for failed messages

Memory Management:
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Streaming for file processing
- Garbage collection tuning
- Memory pooling for frequently allocated objects

Network Optimization:
- HTTP/2 for multiplexing
- gRPC for internal service communication
- Compression (gzip) for large payloads
- CDN for static assets

Performance Metrics:
- Latency P95: 120ms
- Throughput: 5000 req/s
- Memory: 512MB average
- CPU: 35% utilization
