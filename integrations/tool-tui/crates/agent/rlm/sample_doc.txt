LARGE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION - SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

This document contains extensive technical details about our system architecture.
In a real-world scenario, this could be:
- A large codebase documentation
- API specifications
- Research papers
- Legal documents
- Medical records
- Financial reports

The key point is that traditional prompting would fail to process this entire document
in a single API call due to token limits, but RLM can handle it efficiently.
