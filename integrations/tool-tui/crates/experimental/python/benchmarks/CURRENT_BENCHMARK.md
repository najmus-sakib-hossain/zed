# DX-Py Benchmark Report

Latest benchmark results comparing DX-Py against CPython, UV, and pytest.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

DX-Py is currently in active development. The benchmark results below reflect the current state of implementation and should be interpreted with the following caveats: -Feature Coverage: Not all Python features are fully implemented. Benchmarks that use unsupported features are marked as "Not Supported" and excluded from performance comparisons. -Output Validation: All benchmarks now validate that DX-Py produces the same output as CPython. Only benchmarks with matching output are included in speedup calculations. -Honest Reporting: We only report speedups for benchmarks that: -Execute successfully on both runtimes -Produce identical output -Complete without errors

## Methodology

### Output Validation

All benchmarks now include output validation: -Baseline Execution: Run benchmark on CPython and capture stdout -Subject Execution: Run same benchmark on DX-Py and capture stdout -Comparison: Normalize and compare outputs -Classification:-If outputs match → Validated (include in speedup calculations) -If outputs differ → Output Mismatch (exclude from speedup calculations) -If execution fails → Not Supported (exclude from speedup calculations)

### Statistical Analysis

- Central tendency: Mean, median
- Dispersion: Standard deviation, coefficient of variation
- Confidence intervals: 95% CI using t-distribution
- Significance testing: Welch's t-test (p < 0.05)
- Outlier detection: IQR method

### Configuration

+-----------+------------+
| Parameter | Value      |
+===========+============+
| Warmup    | Iterations |

## Reproducing Results

```bash


# Build all components


cd runtime && cargo build --release cd ../package-manager && cargo build --release cd ../test-runner && cargo build --release


# Copy runtime to benchmarks directory


cp runtime/target/release/dx-py.exe benchmarks/


# Build and run benchmarks


cd benchmarks cargo build --release


# Run individual suites with validation


./target/release/benchmark run --suite runtime --iterations 30 --warmup 5 ./target/release/benchmark run --suite package --iterations 30 --warmup 5 ./target/release/benchmark run --suite test_runner --iterations 30 --warmup 5 ```


## Raw Data


Full benchmark data available in JSON format: -`benchmark_results/runtime_*.json` -`benchmark_results/package_*.json` -`benchmark_results/test_runner_*.json`


## Notes


- Results may vary based on system load and hardware
- CPython executed via `uv run python` for consistent environment
- All DX-Py components compiled with `--release` optimizations
- All benchmarks run in isolated processes
- Only validated benchmarks are included in performance comparisons
- Feature coverage is tracked and reported honestly Generated by dx-py-benchmarks framework with output validation
