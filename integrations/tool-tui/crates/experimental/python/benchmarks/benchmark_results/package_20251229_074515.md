## Methodology

### Benchmark Methodology

- Warmup Phase: Each benchmark runs warmup iterations to allow JIT compilation and cache warming. Warmup timings are discarded.
- Measurement Phase: After warmup, measurement iterations are executed and timed. All timings are recorded for statistical analysis.
- Statistical Analysis:
- Mean, median, and standard deviation are computed for all measurements
- 95% confidence intervals are calculated using t-distribution
- Welch's t-test is used for significance testing (p < 0.05)
- Outliers are detected using the IQR method
- Speedup Calculation: Speedup = Baseline Mean / Subject Mean
- Speedup > 1.0 indicates the subject is faster
- Speedup < 1.0 indicates the subject is slower
- Reproducibility: All benchmarks use seeded random number generation where applicable. System information and configuration are recorded with each run.
