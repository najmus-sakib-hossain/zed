# DX-Py Benchmark Comparison

Benchmark comparison data for DX-Py.

## Status: In Development

These benchmarks require output validation before performance claims can be made.

## Notes

- Benchmarks should validate output correctness before reporting timing
- Performance claims require validated output comparison
- See main benchmark framework for validated comparisons
