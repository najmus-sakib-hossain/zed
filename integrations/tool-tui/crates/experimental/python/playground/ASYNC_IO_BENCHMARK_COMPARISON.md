# DX-Py Async I/O Benchmarks

Async I/O benchmark data for DX-Py.

## Status: In Development

These benchmarks require output validation before performance claims can be made.

## Test Environment

+-----------+---------+
| Component | Value   |
+===========+=========+
| OS        | Windows |
+-----------+---------+



## Notes

- Async I/O features are not yet fully implemented
- Performance claims require validated output comparison
- Results should be verified with the main benchmark framework
