# Ai Profile
1. Agent
2. Ask
3. Plan - Ui aqiz like options
4. Study - Notebooklm like sources and acions
5. Deep Research
6. Search - Searxng like search results

# Inspiration
1. Grok like chat session scrollbar in the right + Grok like multiple agents animations + Chat history search + Projects + History + Pin
2. Searxng like search results
3. opsm openai like latex for studying and research
4. google notebooklm like study and research features
5. codex like workspace sidebar

7. claude app like mpc, skills, connect and plugins features

In here please do anything and just study the crates GPUI crate. Tell me how much time do you think it will take to add hot reloading in GPUI so that anything I do related to UI will change automatically instead of building it again and again. 

So notion has introduced agents, which is the perfect example of how our DX agent should be and how the DX agent extension should be. The thing is, they are all kinds of confused and just plugged the AI agent system in a way, so the atmosphere is hot. So we can implement a strike with our DX and claim the throne, so On chat, in the right side, there should be multiple chat options, like what Visual Studio and Cursor can do. Here's the thing: workspace and chat are different things. One workspace can have different agents, and it's bigger than one agent. On the left side, it will be like a Notion light with the DX touch, and it will control the heavy word-spread related stuff, like the combination of Notion and Codex backup. 

1. Auto save after delay by default
2. Lucide cog icon for setting icon
3. diff like of zed code editor chess like to rotated line like vscode!!!

You don't have to run or build anything and don't use tail command at all and just fix these problems:
1. on model picker when I am clicking on the collapse icon in the provider label its closing the whole model picker instead of just collapsing the models under that provider
2. In the file explorer sidebar, there is horizontal scroll because we are not truncating the file and folder names, so please truncate the file and folder names instead of giving horizontal scroll in the file explorer sidebar And also put put details on all files, folders as I told you before correctly
3. the free models are not workings correctly so please do a web search and use curl command to check what the the real api for those free providers and connect them in our code editor correctly and the free list should always be on the top only fevorities list can be top of it no other providers!!!

I have added two screenshots. From the first screenshot, you can see that our chat input should have this one next to the add icon button in the chat input top left There should be, to leave next to it, both having a border and a cancel button. We say then, and they should be like this one.
All the recent copy text, image, and clipboard items will be added to the chat window by clicking this. You will be able to add:
- a screenshot of any window of the current operating system
- any sound of the current operating system from any app window
- from the second image
As you can see, in our code editor file Explorer, there is horizontal scroll happening because we are not translating the files and folder names. Please make sure to track the file and folder names. On hover on any file Explorer item, please do this one:
- if it's a folder, then show the count of the files and folder files in that folder and the size of the folder on the right side
- when hovering the folder in file Explorer, please show the computed kn using tick token RS trade of the file
- also show how many lines of code in that file exist
- if it's media files like audio, video, or things like that, then show the size and its content length
while hovering on the file Explorer, on the right side, please show details!!!

And in our chat input model selector provider label please do these:
Currently in the model picker currently there are provider as a labels put please make the provider labels as options and do these:
1. In the providers labels left provider text please make the text bigger so that the provider names is more visible
2. In the providers label right please add the numbers of the models supported by that provdiers as a badge number
3. Int the provider label most rigth please add collapse and expand icon so that when we click on that icon the models under that provider will be shown and when we click again it will be hidden. Please make sure to use suitable icons from lucide-pack using our icon command

### Nani?
No, its zed code editor for and its worktree and we are solving both worktree and localhost auth problem!!! So please give me right suggestions and rust crates to solve this as I am using latest zed code editor fork that is already so feature rich and just have to add these new features to make our dx the best in the planet!!!

No, there is no warp-tree its woktree(So that multiple agents can work in the same git project without any merge conflicts and can work with each other at once) and there we are solving nextjs and other frameworks all having the auth header while adding auth problem - Dont hallucinates stuffs!!!

There is no jet-agent - we are dx and working on zed codebase as a fork and its maybe a typo and do these correctly using latest crates and searching web correctly!!!

I will do the fix myself. You just list the current problems in a professional way. What current code editor and CLI are you struggling with? We have a fork object coder editor DX that can solve it. No need to give me any code. Just give me long detailed professional markdown with all current problems and how we can solve it. Don't give me any code

# Working
```markdown
Good, but in the status bar center, currently we are showing 7 icons in our chat input next to the submit button. We should show those 7 icons instead of the current icons, and we will show them in error-rounded-md instead of rounded-full. You can find these 7 icons and tooltips in the status bar center and also please revert they thing you did to the left of the chat input submit left side as there are chat session bottom actions button please revert them to the previous state and please make sure to show those 7 icons in the status bar center instead of showing them in the left of the chat input submit button. The 7 icons are:
1. Text
2. Image
3. Video
4. Live
5. Audio
6. 3d/AR/VR
7. PDF, DOCS

As you can see in our chat input at active threads.rs and threadview.rs, there is our chat input. At the status bar, there are seven icons in a rounded border box. Please move that border box to our chat input next to the submit icon in our chat input, and please comment out the follow jet agent icon for now, and please make sure that The seven icon rounded bar should only show five icons at a time. That means there should be four icons just like it. For the last three icons, instead of showing the three icons, we should show a lucid more icon. When we click on the more icon, it will show the rest of the three icons with their options to tip container as the select option, like menu. By default, the text icon should be Marked as a toggle icon border for now. When there will be no space to show all of the five icons, then the options on the more icon will grow. Options in the icons left to the more icons will go inside that more icon to save space. And in our chat input, you can see the zoom button at the chat top right. Please comment it out for now. Please install a message outline-icon from Lucid Fat landing from our icon downloaded system command search CLI. Please create a rounded border popover option where, on the left, please put the message rounded-icon and, on the right, please put a chair burn Lucid up icon. When clicked on the popover option, it will show popular social media like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and so on. For this social media icons, you can use HVCL icon pack from our icon search CLI and create this message popover in the chat input top right. There should be an enhanced prompt icon button, the new message chat input pop over, and a context pie chart should be shown in the chat input top right.

1. Auto save after delay by default
2. Lucide cog icon for setting icon

Please give me latest best rust crate to render in gpui:
1. latex
2. pdf
3. docs
4. microsoft office files like word, excel, powerpoint
5. research papers in different formats

# AI chat input box in the center as rounded border bottom instead of border top only as Previously, the chat input box was like a sidebar, but from now on the chat input box should be the main center. It will have a lot more space, so it needs to be rounded instead of showing only the border top. It will have a lot of space, so it will be like a rounded input box so that it can make good user UI and do good user interaction. 

# AI chat session main render will have 10 dots in the chat input rounded box bottom top center and there are 5 icon button on the right side of the chat input (In our chat session at the bottom right now, we are showing 5 icons instead of showing them in the bottom right. Please show them in the bottom center. And for now on, please hide the like and dislike icon from there)

# Ai chat input session will also having scrollbar in the rigth side will also have a notion line dots like chat links so the users input will be a small vertical line and ai answer will a big vertical line in the right center side of the ai chat session and hovering on the vertical lines it will show the title and some details of the message in the tooltip and also when we click on that vertical line it will scroll to that message in the chat session

# File Explorer Sidebar
```markdown
Currently in the world File Explorer sidebar at our code editor there is horizontal scroll, but horizontal scroll on File Explorer looks very bad. So please make sure to truncate the files and folder names instead of giving horizontal scroll, and there shouldn't be any horizontal scroll in our File Explorer sidebar. 
```

# Model picker free models addition
```markdown
Currently in the model picker currently there are provider as a labels put please make the provider labels as options and do these:
1. In the providers labels left provider text please make the text bigger so that the provider names is more visible
2. In the providers label right please add the numbers of the models supported by that provdiers as a badge number
3. Int the provider label most rigth please add collapse and expand icon so that when we click on that icon the models under that provider will be shown and when we click again it will be hidden. Please make sure to use suitable icons from lucide-pack using our icon command

And in our model picker please add support for free models via our crates/providers crate - there I current added 4 free models from opencode and there are still 3 free models that we can use so please learn from the details of the crates/providers/README.md file and add 2 providers like the opencode.rs called - mlvoca.rs and pollinations.rs add support for these models:
  "pollinations": {
        "api_url": "https://text.pollinations.ai/openai",
        "available_models": [
          {
            "name": "openai-fast",
            "display_name": "OpenAI Fast",
            "max_tokens": 131000,
            "max_output_tokens": 32768,
          },
        ],
      },
      "mlvoca": {
        "api_url": "https://mlvoca.com",
        "available_models": [
          {
            "name": "tinyllama",
            "display_name": "TinyLlama",
            "max_tokens": 131000,
            "max_output_tokens": 32768,
          },
          {
            "name": "deepseek-r1:1.5b",
            "display_name": "DeepSeek R1 1.5B",
            "max_tokens": 131000,
            "max_output_tokens": 32768,
          },
        ],
      },
      
And in our ai providers selector top there should be a new providers called "Free" and in the right of the provider label there should 7 badge and and in the most right of the provider label there should be collapse and expand icon so that when we click on that icon the models under that provider will be shown and when we click again it will be hidden. Please make sure to use suitable icons from lucide-pack using our icon command - Please make those 7 free models functional and integrate in our code editor correctly!!! And we will show those 7 free models everytime even there user didn't configured any providers but those 7 models will show correctly!!!
```
