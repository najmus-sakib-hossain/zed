Like that as an agent listed in the integration agent folder and integrations Tool-tui/crates/agent folder that DX can spawn an agent that can run in the background, both locally and VPS And it can run there 24/7. Latest VIRAL projects like zeroClaw, openClaw are doing it so we have to support that out of the box. Not only that, our DX can also handle real computer using the best latest crates. And we will not only show co-editor when someone opens our app but also we will show a Wispr Flow-like bottom center sound text. You can learn from the integrations 11 labs UI for the GPU implementation of the sound-to-text. Whenever a special hotkey will be pressed it will show a bottom center Wispr Flow-like rounded feel to get the audio. In the integrations www dashboard token folder, we day/app/website folder, you can see the Ai agent face in the landing page top hero section. We have to recreate it in Rust GPU. By default on screen we will show that in the air face in the bottom center, like what was for Flow does, and when the AI is clicked it will open a small instance of our Ai panel flowing into the users operating system. We can run a tiny LLM model for the sound-to-text, unlimited free, and also can run a small Ollama model in the user's operating system to run 24/7 and control the user's operating system correctly.

Previously Zed code editor was revolving around code editing and little bit of ai but from now on as we are forking it and making it our DX, we will revolve around UI and AI generation related. The code editor thing will still be there but we will introduce the AI generative UI system now. The plan is to make our UI as elegant as possible and also we should not only create dummy UI; we should make all the UI changes functional. 

Currently our co-editor AI panel is like a right-side word but from now on by default the AI panel will show. Currently the AI input panel is a full-width container but from now on we will give it a responsive width and will put it in the center with a rounded border.

As you can see we're trying to make the UI as elegant, as functional, and as user-friendly as possible. All the icons and buttons serve a purpose and are not only there for show; they all serve their own different purposes. We've learned from all other places and now we are trying to combine all the inspiration from other platforms to make the best AI platform possible.

Currently you can see in our zed code editor that there are only 3 AI profiles, but from now on we will have 6 AI profiles.

# Ai Profile
1. Agent
2. Ask
3. Plan - copilot-plan.png like plan generation
4. Study - notebooklm.png like Notebooklm like sources and acions
5. Deep Research - deep research like agent with sources and actions(Just put I will work on it later)
6. Search - Searxng like search results(Just put I will work on it later)
And keep in mind when we change the AI profile, the whole AI panel will change according to that AI profile: action buttons and actions. 

And also as you can see from the screenshot that I have given you earlier, on the top left there is a mini icon. When we click on that mini icon it shows a sidebar with Workspace controls. From now on we will expand that sidebar by default. It will be the default navigation system of our software and that sidebar has to be super user-friendly. It will follow the UI system like Notion Sidebar.png and then sidebar.png, with little space dots and on the top there will be one home and other nabs So the WordPress sidebar top will be similar to zensidebar.png, and center items should be like notion sidebar.png, and bottom will be like sidebar.png, with that dot space navigation system like UI. 

And in our chat editor, as you can see, on the left side of our submit button there are five icons:
- text
- image
- audio
- video
- live
- and more icon
When the icon is on text toggle then it will show the plan module selection and all other text model related action buttons. When it will toggle on image then we will show the image related action buttons. The whole chatting boot will be changed to action buttons related to image and other buttons will also do the same, making the chat input action buttons related to their own generation.

As the chat panel will be in the center from now on, for users to scroll easily on the right side center in our AI panel, we will put groups, session history.pnc, like the chat jam system.

And on the chat input top right, you can see a message and a severed down icon. It's a linking system where the AI result and response will be sent to users' social media like Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and so on and users can connect their social media. Please use best REST rates for the social linking and make sure that the social messages go to their users' social media correctly.

So we are currently running on the desktop app of our DX ecosystem. DX will also have other apps and other things and you can learn all about that in the bottom DX details.
