### 1. What Is DX?
DX is not a chatbot. Not just an AI agent. Not another Electron wrapper around an LLM.

DX is a **unified development experience platform** — a single, blazing-fast tool that
connects AI generation, tool calling, media creation, and deep workflow integration
under one roof. Every feature exists for one purpose: **to enhance how developers
and creators build.**

There are no arbitrary category boundaries. Code generation, chart creation, deep
research, video generation, 3D rendering, audio synthesis, real-time conversation
— they are all connected as facets of a single, cohesive experience.

---

### 2. Built on Rust. Not Node.js. Not Electron. Rust.
DX is engineered from the ground up in **Rust** — the same language trusted by
operating systems, browsers, and mission-critical infrastructure.

**Why this matters:**
- **Speed:** Near-native performance on every operation.
- **Efficiency:** Runs smoothly on low-end hardware while unlocking the full
  potential of high-end machines. DX scales with your device — it doesn't
  demand a minimum.
- **Desktop UI:** DX uses **Zed's GPUI framework** for its desktop application,
  making it the fastest AI agent desktop app in the world. While competitors
  (Claude Desktop, Codex, ChatGPT, etc.) ship bloated Electron/Node.js apps,
  DX renders at GPU speed with minimal resource consumption.

**Supported Platforms (Native Apps):**
- macOS
- Linux
- Windows
- Android
- iOS

Every platform gets a true native-grade experience. No compromises.

### 3. Free AI Access — Any Provider, Even Offline
DX provides **free access to AI** with support for virtually any provider:

- **Online:** Connect to any major or minor LLM provider — OpenAI, Anthropic,
  Google, Mistral, open-source endpoints, self-hosted models, and more.
- **Offline:** DX runs capable local models **offline, with no token limits**.
  No internet? No problem. DX still works — unlimited.
- **Hybrid:** Use cloud providers when available, fall back to local seamlessly.

You own your workflow. No vendor lock-in. No forced subscriptions to use
basic features.

### 4. Generate Literally Anything
DX is a universal generation engine:

| Category              | Capabilities                                              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code**              | Any language, any framework, full-project scaffolding      |
| **Charts & Data**     | Visualizations, dashboards, data analysis                  |
| **Deep Research**     | Multi-step reasoning, deep dives, synthesis                |
| **Tool Calling**      | Full support for MCP, ACP, A2A protocols                   |
| **Video**             | AI video generation and editing                            |
| **3D**                | 3D asset and scene generation                              |
| **Audio & Music**     | Sound design, music composition, voice synthesis           |
| **Conversation**      | Real-time voice interaction — talk to DX naturally         |

If you can name it, DX can generate it.

### 5. Revolutionary Token Savings
This is DX's **biggest competitive advantage** over every Vercel-backed,
VC-funded competitor.

#### 5a. RLM (Reference-Length Minimization)
In 2023, MIT researchers proved that **RLM techniques save 80–90% of tokens**
on large files. The industry ignored it. Why? Because RLM is computationally
expensive — and Node.js is too slow to make it practical.

**DX solves this.** Rust's performance eliminates the overhead that makes RLM
impractical. What competitors dismiss as "not worth it," DX runs in real-time.

> *Result: 80–90% token savings on large file operations.*

#### 5b. DX Serializer
Every tool call in the industry sends bloated JSON. DX replaces this with the
**DX Serializer** — a custom, compact serialization format purpose-built for
AI tool communication.

> *Result: 70–90% token savings on every single tool call.*

#### 5c. Compound Savings
RLM + DX Serializer + dozens of micro-optimizations across the entire pipeline.
DX doesn't save tokens in one place — **it saves tokens everywhere.**

This means:
- Your free tier goes further.
- Your paid usage costs a fraction of competitors.
- Complex, multi-step agent workflows become economically viable.

### 6. Extensions Everywhere
DX doesn't live in a silo. It integrates into the tools you already use:

#### Browser Extension
- Works in any Chromium or Firefox-based browser.
- AI assistance on any webpage, any web app.

#### Editor & IDE Extensions
- VS Code, Zed, JetBrains, Neovim, and more.
- DX powers your coding environment directly.

#### Video Editor Plugins
- Adobe Premiere Pro
- CapCut
- DaVinci Resolve
- Filmic Pro

#### Image & Design Plugins
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator
- Affinity Photo
- Affinity Designer
- And virtually any professional-grade creative application.

**The principle:** DX meets you where you work. Every professional tool you
use gains the full power of DX through native extensions.

## Voice & Style Rules
- Use short, punchy sentences for impact. Use longer ones for technical depth.
- Never say "leveraging" or "revolutionizing" — show, don't buzzword.
- Comparisons to competitors should be factual and specific, not petty.
- Code examples, benchmarks, and demos > marketing adjectives.
- Developer respect: assume your reader is smart. Don't over-explain basics.
- Confidence without arrogance: "We built it this way because the math works."
